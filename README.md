# The Same as Always
School project based on making a website to share rides. The rest of my group made the website design, and I made the whole front-end code!
# How to install
```
git clone https://github.com/MoisesLN/TSAL.git
cd TSAL
python -m http.server
```
After that, acess [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) on your browser! This runs a local server (similar to VS Code's extension Live Server).
